[{"human": "What is aws trusted advisor\n", "AI": "AWS Trusted Advisor is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you to optimize your AWS infrastructure, secure your services, and follow AWS best practices. It provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS standards, and it can help you identify ways to reduce costs, improve system performance, and enhance security.\n\nTrusted Advisor checks your AWS environment across five categories: cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service limits. Within each category, it performs specific checks related to the area, such as identifying unused or underutilized Amazon EC2 instances, checking for open security groups, or monitoring for exposed Amazon S3 buckets.\n\nThe service offers different levels of support depending on your AWS plan. For example, with a Business or Enterprise support plan, you can access all checks and configure alerts to notify you when checks fail. With a Developer or Basic support plan, you can access a subset of checks and view the results in the AWS Management Console.\n\nTrusted Advisor is a powerful tool for AWS administrators, helping them maintain a secure, high-performing, and cost-effective AWS infrastructure."}]
